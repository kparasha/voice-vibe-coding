     - Add proper prop types and exports
   - Each step shows checkpoint notification: "üìç Creating interface..."

3. **Debug Point Insertion**
   - User can interrupt by holding `Fn` key and saying: *"Debug here"*
   - Releases `Fn` key ‚Üí AI immediately pauses execution, shows current state
   - User reviews generated code so far
   - User holds `Fn`, says: *"Continue"* or *"Modify approach"*, releases key for immediate execution

4. **Completion & Control**
   - AI completes all operations autonomously
   - Final notification: "üéâ React component created with 4 files"
   - User can accept, reject, or request modifications

### 4. Error Handling & Recovery

**Scenario:** Voice command is unclear or AI makes a mistake

**Journey:**

1. **Ambiguous Command**
   - User: *"Add a function to handle stuff"*
   - AI responds: "ü§î Could you clarify what type of function and what 'stuff' should it handle?"
   - User provides clarification via voice

2. **AI Error Recovery**
   - AI generates incorrect code
   - User says: *"This is wrong, the function should return a promise"*
   - AI automatically corrects and regenerates
   - No manual editing required

3. **Voice Recognition Issues**
   - Poor audio quality or background noise
   - Extension shows: "‚ö†Ô∏è Could not understand. Please try again."
   - User holds `Fn` key and repeats command, releases for immediate processing
   - Automatic noise filtering improves recognition
