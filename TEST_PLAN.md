# Test Plan

## Objectives
- Ensure Voice Vibe Coding extension functions as intended
- Validate accessibility for users with Carpal Tunnel or similar issues
- Test compatibility with AI hardware (vision)

**Tech Stack:**
- TypeScript (preferred) / JavaScript
- VSCode Extension API (OpenVSX/VSCodium compatible)
- npm for package management
- Mocha/Chai for testing
- Node.js-based speech-to-text
- AI/LLM integration for seamless autonomous coding

**Testing Focus:** Validate seamless voice-to-AI pipeline without manual intervention, autonomous agentic flow, and voice-based user controls.

---

## Test Types
- **Unit Tests:** Core modules (command parsing, AI integration, action execution)
- **Integration Tests:** End-to-end seamless voice-to-AI flow without manual intervention
- **Agentic Flow Tests:** Multi-step autonomous operations and debug points
- **Voice Control Tests:** Accept/reject/debug/undo voice commands
- **UI/UX Tests:** Real-time visual and auditory feedback, checkpoint notifications
- **Accessibility Tests:** Complete hands-free operation, zero keyboard/mouse dependency
- **Performance Tests:** Latency of voice-to-AI pipeline and autonomous code generation
- **Security & Privacy Tests:** AI integration security, data handling and permissions
- **Future: Rollback Tests:** Screenshot-based tracking and checkpoint system (Post-MVP)

## Test Scenarios

### Seamless Voice-to-AI Flow
- Voice command triggers AI without manual Enter/click intervention
- AI generates and executes code autonomously based on voice input
- Real-time feedback during AI code generation
- Voice-based accept/reject commands work correctly

### Autonomous Agentic Operations
- Complex multi-step commands execute autonomously
- Debug points can be inserted via voice during execution
- Checkpoint notifications appear at major operation steps
- User can modify approach mid-execution via voice

### Core Functionality
- Voice command creates, edits, deletes code as expected
- Destructive actions require confirmation
- Undo/redo works for all AI-generated actions
- Visual/auditory feedback is clear and timely
- All features accessible via voice only (zero keyboard/mouse dependency)
- System handles ambiguous or invalid commands gracefully
- Extension works with different Node.js STT engines and AI services

### Future Testing (Post-MVP)
- Screenshot-based action tracking accuracy
- Commit-like checkpoint rollback functionality
- Advanced memory system for complex operation debugging
- (Vision) Simulate use with AI hardware (glasses, pendant, etc.)

---

## Accessibility Considerations
- All actions possible without keyboard/mouse (zero manual intervention)
- Fn key as primary activation method (configurable for accessibility needs)
- Clear visual and auditory feedback for all actions
- Support for users with limited mobility and Carpal Tunnel
- Screen reader compatibility for visual impairments
- Voice calibration for different speech patterns and accents
- Fatigue-aware interaction patterns

---

## Critical Testing Requirements (Based on Analysis)

### Extension Configuration Testing
- VSCode extension manifest validation (activationEvents, contributes)
- Webpack bundling and packaging verification
- Cross-platform compatibility (VSCode, Cursor, Windsurf)
- Fn key activation mechanism testing

### Flow State Testing
- Sustained focus sessions (2+ hours)
- Interruption recovery and context preservation
- Cognitive load measurement during complex operations
- Frustration detection and emotional flow support
- Session continuity across coding sessions

### Performance Benchmarks
- Fn key activation response time < 200ms
- Voice-to-AI pipeline latency < 2 seconds
- Real-time transcription accuracy during speech
- Memory usage during background code analysis
- Battery impact assessment for continuous operation

## Future Testing
- Real-world testing on AI hardware (glasses, pendants)
- Multi-user and collaborative scenarios
- Brain-computer interface integration testing
- Advanced rollback system validation
- Cross-device synchronization testing
